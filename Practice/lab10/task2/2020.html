        <textarea class="text-description" disabled onresize="false">The main themes of Parasite are class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity. Film critics and Bong Joon-ho himself have considered the film as a reflection of late-stage capitalism, and some have associated it with the term "Hell Joseon" (Korean: 헬조선), a phrase which has become popular, especially with young people, in the late 2010s to describe the difficulties of life in South Korea.

        <textarea class="text-description" disabled onresize="false">This term came out because of the youth-unemployment due to high education and the crisis of home affordability happening in South Korea.
Critics have also considered the themes of colonialism and imperialism. According to Ju-Hyun Park, the film plays out within "the capitalist economic order inaugurated and upheld in Korea by colonial occupation," and the use of English language in the film denotes prestige within that economic system.
